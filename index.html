    title = "html5 specification">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet.</p>

  <p> Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs).</p>

  <p style = "margin-top : 40px;">Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, and individual users; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information.</p>
